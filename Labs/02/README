Labs are included in /Labs/. https://cs275.aaomidi.com/Labs

Lab 2 documentation:

File location: /Labs/02/aao53_lab2.html

Included styles: Bootstrap
Included scripts: jQuery, timeago (https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago)

Written styles: /templates/style.css, /Labs/02/style.css
Written scripts: /templates/load.js, /Labs/02/script.js

/Labs/02/script.js controls the ajax weather fetching.
It simply gets the API code entered by the user, finds the location of the user using their IP (very inaccurate but works) and returns the weather styled in a table to the client.

The timeago library was included for a better UX.
